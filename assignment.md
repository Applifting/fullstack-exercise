# Backend Developer Exercise

## Introduction

- your task is to implement a simple single-user blogging engine in Node.js or Ruby on Rails
- you don't have to complete all subtasks, just do what you have the time and skills for
- the goal here is not just to see if you can do an app, but how you do it. So please write it as if it were a big production app, that includes code structure, validations, usage of git, documentation, tests, linting, etc.
- we realize that some subtasks can be very time consuming, if you just don't have the time, you can write short text description of how would you solve the problem
- on the flip side, you can improve on many things, if you have the time. For example, we don't need you to implement user registration, but you are free to do so
- feel free to use this exercise (including the instruction) for evaluation by other companies

## Technologies

### Common

- we use Docker for containerization, Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation

### Node.js

- we prefer Restify or Nest.js, Apollo Server, PostgreSQL, TypeORM or Sequelize, Jest and of course TypeScript
- but if you know other technologies and don't want to learn/use any of our favorites, feel free to do so

### Ruby on Rails

- we prefer PostgreSQL and RSpec
- but if you know other technologies and don't want to learn/use any of our favorites, feel free to do so
- bonus points for Sorbet types

## The Exercise

- design the API yourself and document it
  - ideally, create both REST and GraphQL
  - document the API - REST in Swagger, GraphQL with documentation comments in schema
  - write Swagger yourself or generate it, you can expose it as an endpoint
  - for GraphQL, expose GraphiQL or GraphQL Playground
- dockerize your app
  - create a Dockerfile for your app
  - create a docker-compose file that can be used to run your app with all dependencies
- implement login
  - the user should just need a password to login
  - seed the database with user data
- create simple CRUD for blog posts (articles)
  - each article should have title, perex and content
  - each article should also have a unique generated id
  - each article should also have a timestamp
- add the possibility to add comments to articles
  - a comment should have an author (just a string) and content
  - each comment should also have a timestamp
  - comments are flat, with relation only to article
    - nested comments are for bonus points
- add the possibility to vote on comments (Reddit-style + and -)
  - votes should identified by IP address and unique
- add the option to make commenting and voting realtime
  - via GraphQL Subscriptions or WebSockets
- present your ability to test the code
  - You don't have to test everything, add at least some unit tests
  - Optionally also include some integration and e2e tests

# Frontend Developer Exercise

## Introduction

- the goal here is not just to see if you can do an app, but how you do it. So please write it as if it were a big production app, that includes code structure, validations, usage of git, documentation, tests, etc.
- we realize that some subtasks can be very time consuming, if you just don't have the time, you can write short text description of how would you solve the problem
- on the flip side, you can improve on many things, if you have the time. For example, we don't need you to implement user registration, but you are free to do so
- feel free to use this exercise (including the instruction) for evaluation by other companies

## Technologies

### Common

- TypeScript is preferred
- Jest is preferred for unit tests, TestCafe or Cypress for e2e tests
- Sass for styling
- don't worry too much about styling, you can use bootstrap, material or some other library
- Webpack for bundling

### React

- React Router for routing
- Redux, hooks or Apollo Link for state management
- Axios for HTTP requests

### Angular

- NgRx for state management

## Multitenancy and accessing the API

The Applifting Blog Engine has **multitenancy API** - multiple users can use the same application and access their own blog data separately from everyone else. In other words, your content (articles, comments, images) will be available only to you.

In order to access your own “space” in the app, you need to create a tenant first. 

**Creating a tenant**

To do so, send the following request to the API:

`POST https://fullstack.exercise.applifting.cz/tenants`

The request should contain a JSON body with the following fields:

```json
{
	"name": "your-new-tenant-name",
	"password": "your-new-tenant-password"
}
```

The response will contain `apiKey` field. The API key is used to identify your tenant when using any other API endpoint - make sure to write it down!

**NOTE**: The key serves purely as an identifier and as such is not considered to be a secret. That means you can store it in your repository without worrying about security.

**Logging in**

You can now log in with your new tenant. Send the following request:

`POST https://fullstack.exercise.applifting.cz/login`

With this body:

```json
{
	"username": "your-new-tenant-name",
	"password": "your-new-tenant-password"
}
```

You will also need to identify your tenant - this is done by adding a new header to the request:

```
X-API-KEY: "your-tenant-API-key"
```

If successful, you will receive a response with `access_token` field. This token expires in an hour and is used to access protected API capabilities (e.g. uploading images).

**Accessing protected resource**

Whenever you want to access a protected endpoint, you will need to supply:

- `apiKey` to identify your tenant
- `access_token` to authorize yourself

For example, if you want to upload a new image:

`POST https://fullstack.exercise.applifting.cz/images`

you will need to provide the following headers:

```
X-API-KEY: "your-tenant-API-key"
Authorization: "your-access-key"
```
